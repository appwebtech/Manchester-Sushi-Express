# Introduction

This is a [responsive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design) static webpage that I was creating and threw in some irrelevant content instead of using filler text. Digital marketing as many of you might already know is all about user friendliness, speed, decluttering your website, [SEO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization), [SMM](https://searchengineland.com/guide/what-is-social-media-marketing) etc. Many websites are been viewed from mobile apps and many people are no longer patient with  slow platforms which have overwhelming content.

A user who is listening to music on his phone in a bus and is also receiving texts via whatsapp and e-mails doesn't have time to read all the content you have put there unless you are blogging. If you use analytics to track your visitors, then you might realise that 90% of who visit never get past your homepage. 

I have used a lot of colors appealing to the eye making the user glued to the content. The animations and quality images create tight coupling between the pages and the viewports of the user's device. This in turn will make the user play around with the web page and eventually try to order some sushi if it's connected to the [Back-end](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/back-end-architecture). 

I won't go in depth about static websites as I seldom design them, but I reckon that if you are reading this you do follow marketing webinars and you are aware of the current trends, technological shifts, pitfalls, optimizing AdSence and best options to earn from your content eg PPC, CPC & CPM ads.


# What the webpage should do 

There isn't much logic involved here, just simple coding without the fear of plunging yourself into the abyss of debugging. Around 1.5 hour's and everything is set-up because the web page won't do anything beyond it's intended purpose. This kind of single pages, (not to confuse with  [SPAs](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/magazine/dn463786.aspx) are intended for marketing a place, a business or some [papayas](http://www.hawaiipapaya.com/) if designed in Hawaii. 


# Technologies 


## HTML5
[HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) is a [markup language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language) used to format content for it to be readable on a browser. Browsers display such content and examples include Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, IE etc; such content is fetched and displayed via a URL/URI. 

The HTTP protocol ensures data communication within the internet. It supports POST(accept and store data), GET(data retrieval) among other requests like HEAD, DESTROY/DELETE, PATCH etc which form the foundations of RESTful architecture. 

Information on webpages is reinforced by the HTML Semantics which ensure a compatibility between new and old browsers. Complex web API's are well supported and it's "buoyancy" in disposition has seen it embrace new technologies like SVG, Video Streaming, Audio, as well as the adoption of new syntaxes. 


## CSS3
[CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#CSS_3). It's a style language which is used to style documentation written in HTML. This tech is not only used in HTML but extends to XML, SVG and XUL. 

CSS is very versatile in that it can be used to style inline HTML as well as being rendered from outside through SoC. Many stylesheets can be linked to the main HTML page enhancing collaboration and code readability. 


## Font Awesome

> Version 5 â€“ the iconic SVG, font, and CSS framework

The internet's most popular icon toolkit has been redesigned and built from
scratch. On top of this, features like icon font ligatures, an SVG framework,
official NPM packages for popular frontend libraries like React, and access to
a new CDN.
